/* (All your existing CSS is above this) */

.add-link-button {
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: white;
    padding: 12px 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Adds space before the horizontal line */
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-decoration: none; /* Removes the default link underline */
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: center;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.add-link-button:hover {
    background-color: #2980b9; /* A darker blue on hover */
}```

**What we did:**
*   Created a new style rule for the `.add-link-button` class we added in the HTML.
*   Gave it a background color, padding, and rounded corners to make it look like a button.
*   Removed the default link underline with `text-decoration: none;`.
*   Added a simple hover effect for better user experience.

### **3. `script.js` (No Changes Needed)**

Your JavaScript file `script.js` remains exactly the same, as its only job is to fetch and display the data.

### **Next Steps**

1.  Replace the placeholder URL in your `index.html` file.
2.  Add the new CSS rules to your `style.css` file.
3.  Upload the two updated files to your GitHub repository.
4.  Netlify will automatically deploy the changes, and your new button will be live
